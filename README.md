# MSC-project
# Project Objectives
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions and churn patterns.

Preprocess the data for machine learning (handling missing values, encoding, scaling).

Train and evaluate multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).

Analyze feature importance to identify key churn drivers.

Provide actionable business recommendations to reduce churn.
