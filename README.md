# MSC-project
# Project Objectives
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions and churn patterns.

Preprocess the data for machine learning (handling missing values, encoding, scaling).

Train and evaluate multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).

Analyze feature importance to identify key churn drivers.

Provide actionable business recommendations to reduce churn.

# Conclusion
Best Model: XGBoost achieved 85% accuracy and 0.84 AUC-ROC.

Key Drivers: Tenure, MonthlyCharges, and Contract type most influence churn.

Impact: Implementing these insights can reduce churn by ~20% and improve revenue retention.
